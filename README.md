# Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learners
This is the try-out competition after finishing the intro to machine learning courses. I applied all of the method that I learned from the courses such as Random Forest Regressor, Mean Absolute Error, and Train Test Split. Using different values of the houses in the data given, I predicted the sales price of the houses in the city. 

## Competition Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Practice Skills
- Creative feature engineering 
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

## Acknowledgments
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. 

## Goal
It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.
